# Branching Exercise
# Part I
# Answer the following questions:
# What git command creates a branch?
# git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH

# What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
# A fast forward merge happens when git can chronologically merge commits. A recursive merge is a different algorithm combining commits happening at different times from different branches

# What git command changes to another branch?
# git checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH

# What git command deletes a branch?
# git checkout -d NAME_OF_BRANCH
# git checkout -D NAME_OF_BRANCH

# How do merge conflicts happen?
# When branches with conflicting code are merged onto another branch.

# Part II
# Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.

# Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
